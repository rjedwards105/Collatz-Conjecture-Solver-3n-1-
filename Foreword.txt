This program solves the values associated for any number in the Collatz Conjecture, also known as 3n + 1

Collatz Conjecture proposes that for any odd number, it will be multiplied by 3 and then added by 1. If the number is even, it will be divided by 2.

Example:
  
  Say we start with 5. Fifteen is an odd number so will multiply it by 3 and then add 1.

  Now we have 16. Sixteen is an even number so we will divide by 2.

  Now we have 8. Eight is an even number so we will divide by 2 again.

  Now we have 4. Four is also an even number, so we will divide by 2 again.

  Now we have 2. Two is an even number, so we will divide by 2.

  Now we have 1. One is an odd number, so we will multiply it by 3 and the product by 1. By doing so we get 4.

  Notice how we previously had 4 in the sequence.

  Next, we would divide 4 by 2 to get 2 and the once more to get 1.

This is a loop within the conjecture.

For all possible values, they will all end in the four, two, one loop.
